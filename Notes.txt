SOFT DELETE -> is like removing/deleting the user
from application, but the data of that user is still
available in the database.

Result:
    -> The users posts, comments, profile, etc. will hidden/not being displayed in the application.

Why do need SOFT DELETE?
    -> We don't want to totally remove the users yet from
    the application. Meaning, that if we want to restore/activate the user back again, then we easily do that
    because we still have the data of the user in the Db

HOW? we are going to create a  "deleted_at" column in the users
database table.
